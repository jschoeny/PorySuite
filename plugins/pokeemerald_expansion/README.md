# Pokeemerald Expansion Plugin

## About the Plugin

The Pokeemerald Expansion plugin makes it easy to start a Pokémon game using the pokeemerald-expansion as a base. This plugin lets you use the features of the Pokeemerald Expansion, which is a project built on top of pret's pokeemerald decompilation project to bring some of the latest modern Pokémon features to the GBA.

## Features

This plugin is a work in progress. The following features are currently implemented:
- Modify the base stats of any Pokémon
- Modify the name and PokéDex entry of any Pokémon
- Modify the starter Pokémon, including their:
    - Species
    - Level
    - Held Item
    - 1 custom move

## About the Base Repo

The base repository for this plugin is the [Pokeemerald Expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion.git) from RH-Hideout. It is not a standalone romhack, and as such, most features will be unavailable and/or unbalanced if played as is. If you use pokeemerald-expansion in your hack, please add RHH (Rom Hacking Hideout) to your credits list.
